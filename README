My first ESP32 Project

Just a simple clock that displays temperature and humidity, syncs ntp, and also dims the screen during bedtime hours.

Hardware used:

ESP32-Wroom devkit
DHT11 sensor
M5Stack Unit OLED Screen

Future goals:

-reduce screen flicker
-implement multiple screens and a way to switch between them (ie m5stack dual button unit or scroll unit)
-add a buzzer for an alarm clock
